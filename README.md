# PawcioreX - RTF/TXT Edtor

This project is the first one I've created using Windows Forms Technology, as a proccess of learning it. Actually, it is the first one
that I've written after learning some basics of C#. The goal of this application is to ensure capability of manipulating on
*.rtf (RichTextFile) and *.txt (TextFile) files. This includes:

- text and its background/placement editing,
- font color/size/kind editing,
- undo/redo actions,
- support for maintaining system clipboard,
- capability of creating new documents as well as maintaining existing ones,
- capability of saving changes on the disk,
- capability of printing (both black-white/colour),
- author's features like: fast date/time input, choose-font-helper, custom: color palettes, text search/replace functionality, 
automatic changes in documents detecting (this is well seen on saving), etc.

Notes:
- some of the offered solutions (especially text search/find functionality) has poor performance. This is due to the fact, that
in the time I was coding, I haven't had much of an idea about even if regular expressions (REGEX) or lambda expressions capabilities. 
Feel free to make any constructive changes.
